## 💡 Explainer - DataStage Projects

 A **"Project"** is a collaborative workspace in Cloud Pak for Data where you work with data and other assets to accomplish a particular goal. In this case, we are using projects to transform and integrate data with DataStage.

1. Inside the **Create a Project**.

2. select **Local file** and upload the downloaded ZIP file in the folder of this repository.

![1.Upload ZIP file](https://github.com/Client-Engineering-Indonesia/workshop-cdc-datastage/blob/main/Lab%202%20-%20DataStage%20nextGen/Assets/1.Upload%20ZIP%20file.png)

3. After the DataStage Core Lab Project ZIP file is uploaded, provide a unique name for your project (e.g., `DataStage Core Lab_YourInitials`).

![2.Naming the project with initials.](https://github.com/Client-Engineering-Indonesia/workshop-cdc-datastage/blob/main/Lab%202%20-%20DataStage%20nextGen/Assets/2.Naming%20the%20project%20with%20initials.png)

4. Click the **Create** button to create the project.


> **Tip:** Once inside the Assets view, sorting the assets by **Name** in ascending order will assist you in navigating the contents inside the Project.

## 📂 Create DataStage Flows

1. Click into the **NEW Flow** to get started building your DataStage job!

![3.Click new flow button](https://github.com/Client-Engineering-Indonesia/workshop-cdc-datastage/blob/main/Lab%202%20-%20DataStage%20nextGen/Assets/3.Click%20flow%20with%20NEW%20flow%20name.png)

>**Rename these DataStage flows to include your initials.** This will help in identifying your assets.

## 💡 DataStage Flows Explanation

**DataStage flows** are the design-time assets that contain data integration logic. The basic building blocks of a flow are:
*   Data sources that read data
*   Stages that transform the data
*   Data targets that write data
*   Links that connect the sources, stages, and targets

This Core Lab section is divided of two DataStage flows in the project.

1. **NEW Flow**
*   The **NEW Flow** is the starting point for building the core capabilities of DataStage in the Core Lab.

2. **COMPLETED Flow**.

*   The **COMPLETED  Flow** is the final output of the Core Lab, allowing you to have a reference example of the completed flow.

## 🗺️ Overview: Edit the DataStage Flow

Now that you joined the mortgage applicant and application data, It is possible to you to things below:

1. Specify a key column for the Join stage.

2. Add credit score data from a PostgreSQL database.

3. Add a Join stage to join the credit score data with the applicant and application data.

4. Add a Transformer stage to calculate total debt.

5. Add interest rate data from a MongoDB database.

6. Add a Lookup stage to look up interest rates for applicants based on their credit scores.

all this possibilitiies have the hands on within this document below.

> #### 💡 Explainer - DataStage Stages
> A DataStage flow consists of **stages** that are linked together, which describe the flow of data from a data source to a data target. A stage describes a data source, a processing step, or a target system.

---

# 👉 1. Specify the key column for the Join stage

The `Join_on_ID` node joins the data sets using the `ID` column. The next phase is to join the resulting data set with the credit score data using the `EMAIL_ADDRESS` column. In this task, you will specify `EMAIL_ADDRESS` as a key column. 

**Below are steps to do the explanation above:**

1.  Return to your project by clicking the project name in the navigation trail.'

![12. where to press the navigation Trail](https://github.com/Client-Engineering-Indonesia/workshop-cdc-datastage/blob/main/Lab%202%20-%20DataStage%20nextGen/Assets/12.%20where%20to%20press%20the%20navigation%20Trail.png)

2.  On the **Assets** tab, click **Flows > DataStage flows**.

![13. where to find the assests](https://github.com/Client-Engineering-Indonesia/workshop-cdc-datastage/blob/main/Lab%202%20-%20DataStage%20nextGen/Assets/13.%20where%20to%20find%20the%20assests.png)

3.  Open the **Core Demo NEW Flow_your initials** flow.

4.  Double-click the `Join_on_ID` node to edit the settings.

5.  Click the **Output** tab, and expand the **Columns** section.

6.  Click **Edit**.

7.  For the `EMAIL_ADDRESS` column name, check the **Key** box.

![14. Click Email address](https://github.com/Client-Engineering-Indonesia/workshop-cdc-datastage/blob/main/Lab%202%20-%20DataStage%20nextGen/Assets/14.%20Click%20Email%20address.png)

8.  Click **Apply and return**.

9.  Click **Save** to save the `Join_on_ID` node settings.

> #### 💡 Explainer - Asset Browser for DataStage
> The **Asset browser** is used to search for connections and assets and add them to your DataStage flows. You can browse connectors, DataStage subflows, and data assets (.csv, .txt, .xls, etc.). The data can then be previewed before being onboarded to the DataStage flow.
